# Hey, I'm Prajwal 👋

"Code that works is just code that hasn't broken yet" - me, probably

I mess around with quant stuff (my Greeks are all Greek to me), training neural nets that work for reasons I'll figure out later (never), and doing physics sims like Oppenheimer—minus the genius, plus the existential dread.

Zero Wednesday commits. It's become my defining trait and I have no explanation for it.

My code has a success rate that would get me fired if I had a real job. I learn by breaking prod at 2am and discovering new ways to disappoint myself. Most of my repos are experiments that worked once, ideas I'll abandon by next week, and a graveyard of "I'll refactor this later" lies.

Projects live below ↓. Some alive, some dead, most held together by duct tape and spite. 🏴‍☠️
